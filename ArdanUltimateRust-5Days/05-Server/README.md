# Let's Build a Server!

> Please have Rust installed (via RustUp) and a working IDE/editor setup.

We're going to take everything we've learned over the last four weeks, and combine them into a capstone project: a client/server setup, representing data-collection for an Internet-of-Things (IoT) setup.

Obviously, a production-level setup would be a bit more polished and wouldn't use sqlite---but this is a good example of how to put together a Rust project.

At the end of this session, you'll have working templates for a lot of common tasks. You'll also have a good idea of how to structure a Rust project, and how to use the various tools that Rust provides.
